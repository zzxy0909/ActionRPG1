1.7:
 - added NoShadows option for simple background rendering
 - added optional lights disabling for simple background rendering
 - fixed ColorizeTrigger methods

1.6c:
 - DX11 + colorize triggers incompatibility fixed
 - "check for transparency" option deprecated due to net loss of performance when enabled

1.6b:
 - orthographic camera fix

1.6:
 - complete overhaul of mask generating and composition algorithms
 - removed RenderTexture restore operation (performance boost on mobiles)
 - improved compatibility with Unity 5 and Android combination
 - improved 1-pass blur looks (range blur - added outline smoothing) 
 - improved depth sensitivity consistency
 - added colored holograms support
 - added transparency masks support for obstacles
 - added multi-camera rendering support
 - added mask and background downsampling options
 

1.5:
 - added depth sensitivity setting
 - changes to hologram and alpha-hologram special effects

1.4b: added Deferred lighting rendering path support

1.4:
 - added more integration options for 2D projects:
 -- "check render type" toggle allows precision trigger checking with sprites
 -- "alpha hologram" sfx allows hologram effect to work correctly with sprites (and generally produces better resutls than simple hologram)
 - minor fixes

1.3:
 - added Colorize triggers option
 - improved API for disabling/enabling/coloring triggers at runtime
 - fixed D3D anti-aliasing mask flip problem

1.2: Optimized background rendering: Added projection matrix change for background camera allowing rendering of only visible areas.

1.1: Android compatibility added
